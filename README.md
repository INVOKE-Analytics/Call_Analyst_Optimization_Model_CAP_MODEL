# Call Analyst Optimization Model

### Overview
Linear programming is a simple technique where we depict complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. The important word in the previous sentence is depicted. The real relationships might be much more complex – but we can simplify them to linear relationships.

### Objective
To build an optimization model that guide our manpower (call agents) allocation for survey works in order to complete all survey projects in a timely manner.

### Dependencies
1. [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) - Data Driven Web-based apps
2. [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction) - Linear Optimization

### Future work
1. Each jobs have it own dateline, to revise the solution approach to relocate the manpower once any of the job dateline has finished.
2. To formulate a mitigation action if the model unable to find an optimal solution
